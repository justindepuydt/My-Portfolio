                            <p> was working with Justin for over two years at Oxford International Education Group. I was doing student recruitment at that time.
Justin developed our North American language business with a focus on summer programs. Specifically due to Justin, we had returning groups, leaders and individual students.
Summer programs are full of challenges, and Justin always handled them with grace, skill, care and humor. I know people talk about work/life balance, but when it comes to language programs during peak season, Justin was willing to do whatever it took to resolve the situation and make our clients super happy, which was incredibly helpful and made recruitment job much easier.</p>

We worked together at Shorelight Education, and he was able to build client relationships in one of the most challenging international ed. markets in the country (Southern California). He would be a welcome addition to any team.</p>
